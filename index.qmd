## Welcome

## What is QuPath?

QuPath is an open-source image analysis program

<br/>

**Key feature**:  
QuPath has a graphical user interface (`GUI`) for performant working with very large 2D images, like those produced by slide scanners

## A bit of background

- project was started at The Queen's University Belfast by Pete Bankhead
- first public release was in October 2016
- currently developed by [Pete Bankhead's group at The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead)
- \>7500 publications [using QuPath](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=qupath)

## Strengths of QuPath

- Was designed for very large, multiscale 2D files

- Includes extensitve annotation, overlay, and visualization options

- It includes robust algorithms for common analysis tasks

- It includes *interactive* machine learning for pixel and object classification

- Recordable workflows allow for easy batch processing

- Integrated ImageJ

- Robust scripting support (Groovy)

## Limitations

- Limited *3D viewing* capabilities:
    - single planes only

- Some complex functions require scripting

- Extension ecosystem is relatively limited

## Anatomy of a QuPath `project`

- `projects` are the best way to organize your analysis work
- `projects` are frequently required by some scripts/extensions
- `projects` are folders:
    - group together related images
    - organize data, scripts, classifiers, etc. 

## Anatomy of a QuPath `project`

### How create a project?

- `Create project` button
- File ‣ Project… ‣ Create project

**When making a project, remember to ceate a folder for it!**
:::

- Drag-and-drop an empty folder

## Anatomy of a QuPath `project`

### How to add images?

- Drag and drop
- File ‣ Project… ‣ Add images

:::{.callout-note}
#### image files will not be copied into your `project` folder!
- A link (`URI`) will be used! 
- If you move the file(s) you will be prompted to update the link.

:::aside
QuPath can handle large 2D images, e.g. whole-slide images—*there is no need to make tiles first*
:::

## Anatomy of a QuPath `project`

### QuPath will never edit your image files!
- `images` in a `project` are actually QuPath objects holding metadata, annotations, etc.
- The image data/pixels are accessed from the files via an `ImageServer`
- Duplicating/saving `images` within a `project` only relates to QuPath specific data, **not** the original files or pixels

:::{.callout-important}
### When images are removed from a project, the data files are not deleted!

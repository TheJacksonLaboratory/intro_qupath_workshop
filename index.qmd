## Welcome

## What is QuPath?

QuPath is an open-source image analysis program

<br/>

**Key feature**:  
QuPath has a graphical user interface (`GUI`) for performant working with very large 2D images, like those produced by slide scanners

## A bit of background

- project was started at The Queen's University Belfast by Pete Bankhead
- first public release was in October 2016
- currently developed by [Pete Bankhead's group at The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead)
- \>7500 publications [using QuPath](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=qupath)

## Strengths of QuPath

- Was designed for very large, multiscale 2D files

- Includes extensitve annotation, overlay, and visualization options

- It includes robust algorithms for common analysis tasks

- It includes *interactive* machine learning for pixel and object classification

- Recordable workflows allow for easy batch processing

- Integrated ImageJ

- Robust scripting support (Groovy)

## Limitations

- Limited *3D viewing* capabilities:
    - single planes only

- Some complex functions require scripting

- Extension ecosystem is relatively limited

## Getting help

- In-app documentation: Help menu
- Online documentation: [https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
    - Includes tutorials, scripting, advanced concepts
- YouTube Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/c/QuPath](https://www.youtube.com/c/QuPath)
- Image.sc Forums: [https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath](https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath)

## Key concept: QuPath `project`

- `projects` are the best way to organize your analysis work
- `projects` are frequently required by some scripts/extensions
- `projects` are folders:
    - group together related images
    - organize data, scripts, classifiers, etc. 

## How create a project?

- `Create project` button
- File ‣ Project… ‣ Create project

:::{.callout-important}
**When making a project, remember to ceate a folder for it!**
:::

- Drag-and-drop an empty folder

## Anatomy of a QuPath `project`

![](images/project_folder.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing the contents of a QuPath project folder." fig-align="center"}

## How to add images to a project?

- Drag and drop
- File ‣ Project… ‣ Add images

:::{.callout-note}
#### image files will not be copied into your `project` folder!
- A link (`URI`) will be used! 
- If you move the file(s) you will be prompted to update the link.
:::

:::aside
QuPath can handle large 2D images, e.g. whole-slide images—*there is no need to make tiles first*
:::

## QuPath will never edit your image files!
- `images` in a `project` are actually QuPath objects holding metadata, annotations, etc.
- The image data/pixels are accessed from the files via an `ImageServer`
- Duplicating/saving `images` within a `project` only relates to QuPath specific data, **not** the original files or pixels

:::{.callout-important}
### When images are removed from a project, the data files are not deleted!
:::

# Let's make our first QuPath project!

## Launch QuPath

![](images/qupath_welcome.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing the QuPath welcome screen." fig-align="center"}

## Click `Create project`

![](images/create_project_1.png){fig-alt="Inset of screenshot showing the `create project` button in red." fig-align="center"}

## Make sure to make a new, empty folder

![](images/create_project_2.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing the file browser with the `New Folder` button in red." fig-align="center"}

## Select the empty folder for the project

![](images/create_project_3.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing the file browser with empty project folder." fig-align="center"}

## Add an image

![](images/add_image_1.png){fig-alt="Inset of screenshot showing the `Add images` button in red." fig-align="center"}

### Use drag-and-drop!

## Use `Choose files`—or drag-and-drop

![](images/add_image_2.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of `Import images to project` dialog with `Choose files` button in red." fig-align="center"}

## Click `Import`

![](images/add_image_3.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of `Import images to project` dialog." fig-align="center"}

### Defaults are OK for the majority of cases

## Welcome

## What is QuPath?

QuPath is an open-source image analysis program

<br/>

**Key feature**:  
QuPath has a graphical user interface (`GUI`) for performant working with very large 2D images, like those produced by slide scanners

---

## A bit of background

- project was started at The Queen's University Belfast by Pete Bankhead
- first public release was in October 2016
- currently developed by [Pete Bankhead's group at The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/peter-bankhead)
- \>7500 publications [using QuPath](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=qupath)

## Strengths of QuPath

- It was designed for handling very large 2D files common to whole-slide imaging techniques

- It includes robust algorithms for common analysis tasks

- It includes *interactive* machine learning for pixel and object classification

- Recordable workflows allow for easy batch processing

- Integrated ImageJ

- Robust scripting support (Groovy)

---

## Limitations

- Limited *3D viewing* capabilities:
    - single planes only

- Some complex functions require scripting
